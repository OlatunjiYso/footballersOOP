# footballersOOP
A simple demonstration of Javascript OOP modeling for footballers

This repository models a base class of footballers from which we have two other classes which are :
### Striker and  Goalkeeper
Striker and goalkeeper both inherit from footballer class
To demonstrate polymorphism, the same method name can be called on a footballer subclass and gives a result, however, this names have different underlying programming logic.
